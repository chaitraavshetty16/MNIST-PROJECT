In the subject of pattern categorization, the issue of handwritten digit recognition has long been unsolved. Numerous research has demonstrated the excellent and effective performance of neural networks and machine learning. This research presents an unsupervised learning technique of spiking neural network (SNN) for handwritten digital recognition utilizing physiologically relevant principles. In order to create the connection between neurons, the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model was first developed using the pre- and postsynaptic trace learning rule. Second, the initial presynaptic weights and axon delay in the neural network were optimized using the genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, training and testing were performed using the Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset. The proposed method can successfully increase the rate at which handwritten numbers are recognized, according to experimental findings, and it can also enable unsupervised learning of handwritten digital recognition. Using this improved unsupervised SNN learning technique, accuracy in the MNIST benchmark test is increased. As a result of the significant reduction in computing complexity, calculation speed has enhanced. The simulation results are superior to the use of the earlier unsupervised SNNs.
